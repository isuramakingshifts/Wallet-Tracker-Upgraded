Sup! I made this cool bot that copies what those big brain wallets are doing on Solana. Pretty simple stuff - when they buy something new, you buy it too. When they sell, you sell! 

## 🤔 How Does It Work?

It's actually super simple:
1. You tell it which wallets to watch
2. It sees when they make trades
3. If they buy something new, the bot buys it too
4. If they sell, the bot sells (no one likes holding bags 😅)

## 🔧 Setting It Up

1. Fork this repo
2. Host it on Railway (super easy, trust me)
   - Use [my Railway link](https://railway.app?referralCode=jtXU_3) for $5 free credit! 
   - Or just use [railway.app](https://railway.app) if you prefer
3. Add your API keys and stuff to Railway as environment variables/
4. You're ready to go! 🎮

To add wallet you can use this repo - [Manager](https://github.com/isuramakingshifts/Wallet-Manager-For-Wallet-Tracker)
